# Database Ownership and Tenant Isolation

`@bap/db` is the only application database boundary. It loads individual
host/port/database/user values and a protected password file. Password-bearing
connection URLs are not accepted.

## Roles

| Role            | Purpose                                  | Owner membership | RLS bypass |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| `bap_owner`     | Own schemas and reviewed objects         | Not a login      | No         |
| `bap_migrator`  | Run reviewed migrations after `SET ROLE` | SET only         | No         |
| `bap_auth`      | Better Auth tables and rate limits       | None             | No         |
| `bap_api`       | Application membership resolver          | None             | No         |
| `bap_reporting` | Reporting membership resolver            | None             | No         |
| `bap_backup`    | Full read-only logical dump              | None             | Yes        |

Every login role is `NOINHERIT`, `NOSUPERUSER`, `NOCREATEDB`, `NOCREATEROLE`,
and `NOREPLICATION`. Runtime roles cannot select auth base tables. The backup
role has no DML, DDL, schema creation, or `SET ROLE` ability.

## Migrations

Reviewed migrations live only in `packages/db/drizzle`. The runner takes a
PostgreSQL advisory lock, checks immutable SHA-256 checksums, begins one
transaction, sets the owner role locally, and records the migration version.
Application startup never migrates.

Fresh local and CI databases run role bootstrap first, then the migrator.
Production repeats those idempotent commands with administrator and migrator
credential files mounted only to their one-shot services.

## Tenant policy contract

Every future tenant table must include:

- a non-null `organization_id`;
- an index beginning with `organization_id`;
- `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`;
- a `USING` policy for reads and changes;
- a matching `WITH CHECK` policy for inserted or changed rows.

Tenant context is set with `SET LOCAL` inside one transaction. It cannot persist
through pooled connections after commit or rollback. Missing context fails
closed. Production migrations never enumerate disposable RLS test fixtures.

## Verification

The PostgreSQL 18.6 integration suite proves concurrent migration locking,
checksum behavior, exact grants, membership resolution, missing context,
cross-organization forced RLS, transaction reset, Better Auth rate-limit access,
full `pg_dump` as `bap_backup`, and denial of backup writes, schema changes, and
owner role changes.
